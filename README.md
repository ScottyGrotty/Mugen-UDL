### Trigger highlights
This feature was implemented to enhance the tracking and management of logic flow within the code, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple triggers within long blocks. The color scheme chosen for Trigger highlighting is a carefully selected muted shade of pastel blue-purple, which allows it to seamlessly blend with all preset themes in Notepad++.
